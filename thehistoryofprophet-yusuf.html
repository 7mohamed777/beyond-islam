    <h1>🌟 The Story of Prophet Yusuf (A.S)</h1>

    <h2>🌠 1. Yusuf’s Dream and His Father’s Advice</h2>
    <p>Prophet Yusuf (A.S) was the beloved son of Prophet Yaqub (A.S). One night, he dreamed that eleven stars, the sun, and the moon were prostrating to him. His father recognized this as a sign of greatness and warned him not to tell his brothers, who might become jealous.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Surah Yusuf, 12:4–5</strong><br>
      إِنِّى رَأَيْتُ أَحَدَ عَشَرَ كَوْكَبًۭا وَٱلشَّمْسَ وَٱلْقَمَرَ...<br>
      <em>“I have seen eleven stars and the sun and the moon; I saw them prostrating to me.”</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>😠 2. The Brothers’ Jealousy and the Plot</h2>
    <p>Yusuf’s brothers grew jealous of their father’s love for him. Out of envy, they plotted to get rid of him. They threw him into a deep well and returned to Yaqub (A.S) with a false story that a wolf had devoured him.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Surah Yusuf, 12:9–15</strong><br>
      ٱقْتُلُوا۟ يُوسُفَ أَوِ ٱطْرَحُوهُ أَرْضًۭا...<br>
      <em>“Kill Yusuf or cast him out to [another] land…”</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>🚶 3. Yusuf Is Found and Sold Into Slavery</h2>
    <p>A passing caravan found Yusuf (A.S) and sold him in Egypt as a slave for a small price. But Allah had a greater plan for him.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Surah Yusuf, 12:19–20</strong><br>
      وَجَآءَتْ سَيَّارَةٌۭ فَأَرْسَلُوا۟ وَارِدَهُمْ فَأَدْلَىٰ دَلْوَهُۥ...<br>
      <em>“Good news! Here is a boy.”</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>🏛️ 4. Yusuf in the House of Al-Aziz</h2>
    <p>In Egypt, Yusuf (A.S) was purchased by Al-Aziz, a nobleman. His wife attempted to seduce him, but Yusuf remained steadfast and sought refuge in Allah. When the truth came out, he was still imprisoned unjustly.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Surah Yusuf, 12:23</strong><br>
      وَرَٰوَدَتْهُ ٱلَّتِى هُوَ فِى بَيْتِهَا...<br>
      <em>“She, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him.”</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>🔍 5. Yusuf in Prison and Interpretation of Dreams</h2>
    <p>While in prison, Yusuf (A.S) interpreted the dreams of two inmates. Later, when the king had a strange dream, Yusuf was summoned to interpret it — foretelling seven years of prosperity followed by seven years of famine.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Surah Yusuf, 12:43–49</strong><br>
      سَبْعَ بَقَرَاتٍۢ سِمَانٍۢ يَأْكُلُهُنَّ سَبْعٌ عِجَافٌۭ...<br>
      <em>“Seven fat cows eaten by seven lean ones…”</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>👑 6. Yusuf’s Release and Rise to Power</h2>
    <p>The king, impressed by Yusuf’s wisdom and honesty, appointed him as the treasurer of Egypt — placing him in charge of storing grain for the coming years of famine.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Surah Yusuf, 12:54–55</strong><br>
      ٱئْتُونِى بِهِۦ أَسْتَخْلِصْهُ لِنَفْسِى...<br>
      <em>“Bring him to me; I will appoint him exclusively for myself.”</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>🤝 7. The Reunion with His Family</h2>
    <p>During the famine, Yusuf’s brothers came to Egypt seeking food. After testing them and ensuring their repentance, he revealed his true identity and forgave them wholeheartedly. His earlier dream came true when his family bowed before him in respect and gratitude.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Surah Yusuf, 12:92 & 12:100</strong><br>
      لَا تَثْرِيبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلْيَوْمَ...<br>
      <em>“No blame will there be upon you today.”</em><br><br>
      وَخَرُّوا۟ لَهُۥ سُجَّدًۭا<br>
      <em>“And they bowed to him in prostration.”</em></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h2>✅ Conclusion: Lessons from Yusuf (A.S)</h2>
    <p>The story of Prophet Yusuf (A.S) is one of patience, purity, forgiveness, and trust in Allah’s plan. Despite betrayal, imprisonment, and hardship, he remained grateful and steadfast in faith.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Surah Yusuf, 12:111</strong><br>
      لَّقَدْ كَانَ فِى قَصَصِهِمْ عِبْرَةٌۭ لِّأُو۟لِى ٱلْأَلْبَـٰبِ...<br>
      <em>“There was certainly in their stories a lesson for those of understanding.”</em></p>
    </blockquote>
