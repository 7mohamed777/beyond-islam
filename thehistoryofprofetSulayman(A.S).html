<h1>👑 The Detailed Story of Prophet Sulayman (A.S)</h1>

<h2>🌿 1. A Blessed Birth and a Noble Lineage</h2>
<p>
Prophet Sulayman (A.S) was the son of Prophet Dawud (A.S), a beloved prophet and king.  
He grew up in a household filled with faith, worship, and wisdom. From childhood, Sulayman displayed intelligence, gentleness, and spiritual maturity far beyond his age.
</p>
<p>
He was taught not only the religion of Allah but also statecraft, leadership, and judgment.  
His father often involved him in matters of governance, preparing him for the great responsibilities Allah would later grant him.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Surah An-Naml, 27:15</strong><br>
وَلَقَدْ آتَيْنَا دَاوُودَ وَسُلَيْمَانَ عِلْمًا<br>
<em>“We granted knowledge to Dawud and Sulayman.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>⚖️ 2. The Case of the Two Women – Early Wisdom</h2>
<p>
One of the earliest signs of Allah’s gift to Sulayman (A.S) came during a dispute between two women who claimed to be the mother of a child. Dawud (A.S) gave his ruling, but Sulayman, despite being young, saw deeper into the matter.
</p>

<p>
He proposed a solution that revealed the true mother through her compassion, demonstrating incredible insight and justice.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Surah Al-Anbiya, 21:79</strong><br>
فَفَهَّمْنَاهَا سُلَيْمَانَ<br>
<em>“We gave Sulayman the correct understanding.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>📜 3. Inheriting the Throne of Prophethood and Kingship</h2>
<p>
After the death of Dawud (A.S), Sulayman became both king and prophet.  
His kingdom was vast, organized, and powerful, yet just and compassionate.  
He established systems of law, economic management, and diplomacy unrivaled at the time.
</p>

<p>
His leadership was marked by fairness, wisdom, and constant remembrance of Allah.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Surah An-Naml, 27:16</strong><br>
وَرِثَ سُلَيْمَانُ دَاوُودَ<br>
<em>“Sulayman inherited Dawud…”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>🕊️ 4. Unique Gifts: Command Over Jinn, Humans, Birds, and the Wind</h2>
<p>
Allah granted Sulayman (A.S) a kingdom unlike any before or after:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>He could command the wind to carry him across lands.</li>
  <li>He understood the language of animals.</li>
  <li>The jinn worked for him, building monuments and diving into the seas.</li>
  <li>Birds served as scouts and messengers.</li>
  <li>Humans and jinn served in his army with perfect discipline.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Surah Sad, 38:36–38</strong><br>
فَسَخَّرْنَا لَهُ الرِّيحَ ... وَالشَّيَاطِينَ كُلَّ بَنَّاءٍ وَغَوَّاصٍ<br>
<em>“We subjected to him the wind… and the devils, every builder and diver.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>🐜 5. The Valley of the Ants</h2>
<p>
One of the most beautiful episodes in his story occurred when Sulayman’s vast army—humans, jinn, and birds—marched through a valley.
</p>

<p>
The chief of the ants warned its people:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Surah An-Naml, 27:18</strong><br>
ادْخُلُوا مَسَاكِنَكُمْ لَا يَحْطِمَنَّكُمْ سُلَيْمَانُ وَجُنُودُهُ<br>
<em>“Enter your homes lest Sulayman and his soldiers crush you unknowingly.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Sulayman (A.S) smiled, grateful to Allah for giving him the ability to understand creatures so small.
</p>

<h2>🕊️ 6. The Hoopoe’s Discovery of Sheba</h2>
<p>
The hoopoe bird (Hudhud), who served as a scout, reported an extraordinary discovery:  
a powerful queen, Bilqis of Sheba, who ruled a wealthy and advanced nation—but they worshipped the sun instead of Allah.
</p>

<p>
Intrigued and saddened by their disbelief, Sulayman sent her a letter calling her to Allah.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Surah An-Naml, 27:30–31</strong><br>
إِنَّهُ مِن سُلَيْمَانَ وَإِنَّهُ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ<br>
<em>“It is from Sulayman and it reads: In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate.”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>👑 7. Queen Bilqis’s Response and Diplomacy</h2>
<p>
The queen, known for her intelligence, decided not to wage war but to send a magnificent gift to Sulayman to test whether he was a worldly king or a true prophet.
</p>

<p>
Sulayman rejected the gift, proving he was not seeking wealth, but faith and justice.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Surah An-Naml, 27:36</strong><br>
أَتُمِدُّونَنِ بِمَالٍ<br>
<em>“Do you wish to provide me with wealth?”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>⚡ 8. The Miracle of the Transported Throne</h2>
<p>
Before the queen arrived, Sulayman (A.S) asked who could bring her throne to him.
</p>

<p>
A strong jinn offered to bring it before Sulayman rose from his seat, but a righteous man with knowledge of the Book brought it instantly—faster than a blink.
</p>

<p>
This miracle left Sulayman in awe of Allah’s power.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Surah An-Naml, 27:40</strong><br>
فَلَمَّا رَآهُ مُسْتَقِرًّا عِندَهُ<br>
<em>“When he saw it placed firmly before him…”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>🏰 9. The Glass Palace and Her Submission to Allah</h2>
<p>
When Bilqis arrived, Sulayman welcomed her into a palace with a crystal floor that looked like water.  
She lifted her garment, thinking she was stepping into a pool.
</p>

<p>
Realizing the kingdom’s sophistication and Sulayman’s prophethood, she embraced Islam sincerely.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Surah An-Naml, 27:44</strong><br>
رَبِّ إِنِّي ظَلَمْتُ نَفْسِي<br>
<em>“My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself…”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>🏗️ 10. Grand Projects and Discoveries</h2>
<p>
Sulayman (A.S) used his God-given powers to build astonishing structures:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Majestic palaces</li>
  <li>Water systems</li>
  <li>Fortified cities</li>
  <li>Places of worship</li>
  <li>Monuments crafted by the jinn</li>
</ul>

<p>
He also explored natural sciences, animals, agriculture, and meteorology—always acknowledging Allah as the source of knowledge.
</p>

<h2>🤲 11. His Humility and Constant Prayers</h2>
<p>
Despite his power, he stayed humble.  
He made dua asking Allah for forgiveness and a kingdom that would show Allah’s greatness.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Surah Sad, 38:35</strong><br>
رَبِّ اغْفِرْ لِي وَهَبْ لِي مُلْكًا<br>
<em>“My Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom…”</em></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>🕯️ 12. The Miraculous Death of Sulayman (A.S)</h2>
<p>
Sulayman (A.S) passed away while standing in prayer, leaning on his staff as the jinn continued working.
</p>

<p>
They did not know he had died until a termite gnawed through his staff and his body collapsed.
</p>

<p>
This event proved that the jinn do not know the unseen—contrary to what people believed.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Surah Saba, 34:14</strong><br>
فَلَمَّا خَرَّ تَبَيَّنَتِ الْجِنُّ<br>
<em>“When he fell, it became clear to the jinn…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
